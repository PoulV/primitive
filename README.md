primitive
=========
Hi, guys! Here is one more lib that uses Selenium Webdriver.

I have no idea how to call it by now. So I named it as “Primitive”. I will change its name if I have any idea. :)

The general idea was to provide ability for automated test execution which would interact with browser window, web page, or web page elements. Also it should work with more than one instance of webdriver in multithread environment. I’m sure it would be useful for developing automated test cases of any complexity.

Now it is rather rough and has some issues but still works. Also, I am sorry for my English in comments to source code. My excuse is that I had not enough time for good translation from Russian. But all these problems will be fixed while I am working on projects with the following tools: Html Elements (by Yandex) and thucydides.

You can check out sources. 

I made it just for fun.
